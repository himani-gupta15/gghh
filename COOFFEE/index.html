      <p> For millions of people, coffee is an essential morning tradition that fuels the start of their day—and most of the time, you probably don’t even think about it. But behind every sip of coffee, there’s a fascinating story that begins in the country where it was grown and ends with the choice of cup that carries it to your lips.</p><br>
      <p> Do you ever think about how much coffee you drink, and how that consumption affects your health? Here are some interesting and fun facts, trends and industry statistics you should know.

People spend approximately $40 billion on coffee annually.
Coffee lowers the risk of Type II diabetes and liver disease.
A person’s coffee consumption increases by 25% when they reach their 20s.
People aged 60+ drink the most coffee. 68% of them are daily consumers.
37% of children aged 13-18 drink coffee.
54% of people drink coffee daily.
Studies have shown that caffeine consumption, up to the equivalent amount found in 5 cups of caffeinated coffee, does not cause dehydration.
There may be a mild short-term diuretic effect from caffeine but this is not strong enough to outweigh the benefits of fluid intake from coffee consumption.
Research suggests that moderate caffeine consumption does not alter total body water and fluid distribution and drinking a variety of caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, can contribute to meeting the body’s requirement for fluids.
The body of evidence available suggests that advice to abstain from coffee drinking to maintain fluid balance is unfounded.</p><br>

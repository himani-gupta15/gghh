    <h1>LIST OF MOST COMMON COFFEE DRINKS!</h1>
    <ol>
      <h5>LIBERICA:</h5>
      <p>There is another Coffea species that’s worth noting in this guide – Coffea liberica, referred to as Liberica.
      Liberica beans are often cited as the third most common type of beans available on the market.Coffea liberica is mostly grown in the Philippines and a few other Southeast Asian countries.
      In reality, Liberica coffee is prettymuch consumed only where it’s grown and it’s rarely exported, because, to be honest, it’s not the best in terms of taste.
      If exported, its beans are mainly used in blends. Despite that, some passionate coffee enthusiasts (like myself) seek Liberica beans in specialty coffee shops around the world, more driven by their curiosity than the beans’ overall reputation.
      You may also come across a few online sources which suggest that there are actually four types of coffee beans.
      The fourth one is Excelsa, which was thought to be a separate Coffea species, but it’s actually a variety of Liberica (Coffea liberica var. Dewevre).Just like Liberica, Excelsa coffee is grown mainly in the Philippines and it’s hard to find its beans elsewhere.
      Even though it captivates the interest of specialty coffee lovers, Excelsa coffee never really makes it to the average consumer’s cup.</p>
      <h5>ARABICA:</h5>
      <p>When speaking of the different types of coffee beans it’s just not possible to leave the Coffea arabica out.
      This coffee species is definitely the most interesting one, and there are many reasons why its beans are the most widely spread around the world.
      It’s generally considered that Arabica coffee beans are of higher quality than Robusta ones.
      Compared to Robusta, Arabica coffee is mellower, more enjoyable.
      At the same time, the taste profile of Arabica beans is more complex – with hints of fruits, pleasant perceived acidity, and sweet flavor notes.
      The characteristics of Arabica coffee beans can largely vary depending on the exact Arabica variety your coffee is made of.
      For example, the highly-priced “Geisha” coffee variety can produce a cup with an intense aroma and exceptional floral notes.
      The SL-28 variety has larger than average coffee beans and it’s known to produce coffee with well-pronounced fruit flavors that are often compared to blackcurrant.</p>
      <h5>ROBUSTA:</h5>
      <p>The Coffea canephora species, commonly known as Robusta was discovered later than Coffea arabica in the late 19th century.
      The species actually got its common name from its highly valued sturdiness.
      Robusta could grow and fruit at lower altitudes and higher temperatures.
      Furthermore, Robusta was more resistant to disease and it had twice the amount of caffeine of Arabica.
      On top of that Coffea canephora plants produced a higher yield. So it’s pretty clear why Robusta quickly gained everyone’s attention – it was cheaper to produce and therefore – more profitable for producers.
      So more and more people situated between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer started to grow Coffea canephora.
      For the very same reasons, Robusta beans are the second most produced and widely spread type of beans to this day.
      Unfortunately, Robusta coffee doesn’t have a great reputation when it comes to flavor.</p>
